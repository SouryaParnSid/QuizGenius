PROJECTS
WasteSamaritan – AI-Based Waste Management System | Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Supabase, React, TypeScript
JPMC CodeForGood (Winner)
•Built a FastAPI backend with Supabase and PostgreSQL to process, store, and route waste classification data from a Gemini 2.5 
VLM, optimizing collector assignments using geolocation and operational load.
•Integrated a multi-label image classification pipeline using confidence-scored outputs to categorize unstructured visual waste data 
into wet, recyclable, and non-recyclable types.
•Implemented multilingual input support and category-wise tracking features, enabling real-world deployment for NGO waste field 
teams via a React + TypeScript frontend.
R.E.M. Virtual Assistant | Python, Eel, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, pyttsx3, SpeechRecognition, OpenCV, LLaMA (Meta), SQLite
•Developed a Python-based virtual assistant with Eel, combining HTML/CSS/JS frontend and a Python backend. Integrated pyttsx3 
for text-to-speech, SpeechRecognition for voice input, and OpenCV for face authentication. Powered by Meta’s LLaMA LLM for AI 
responses and SQLite for data storage
•Enabled WhatsApp calls, Windows app launches, and YouTube playback for a secure, user-friendly experience.
